# Goals I want to achieve.


I have two safe(core) Account Abstraction wallets. Lets call it w1,w2.

w1 has some amount of (t1) ERC20 token .

w2 has some amount of (t2) ERC20 token .

I want w1 to place a limit order for 't2' erc20 token to w1 in exchange of 't1' erc20 token.


# Issue
after building the tx on the safe wallet which calls the registerAllowedOrderSigner and then executing it, what should I do next. i have pasted the transaction reciept at the end of the 2nd file.
